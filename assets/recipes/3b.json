Oh, I doubled it and added a little extra egg to help hold them together. Worked out great! Thanks so much for an amazing recipe!"

I eat them, because people act all shocked when you aren't excited about eating a burger at a bbq and are so freaking proud of procuring veggie burgers and then cooking them JUST FOR YOU. Black bean burgers (or really any bean burgers) are pretty much heaped at the bottom of the pile right alongside a grilled portobello for me. They tend to be thick and gluey and flavorless and if I must eat something on a bun can I just stick to pickles and cheese & mustard please? \n\nBUT ANYWAY I love Kenji's vegetarian recipes so if he says something is REALLY AWESOME and then argues why it's not your regular suck-fest of a black bean burger? I'm in!\n\nAnd these are great! The first time I made them the held up beautifully and looked just like the picture. The second time I made them everything DID turn into mush and I thought, \"oh, no!\" but they were still awesome. \n\nI use the recipe to make 8 patties because I prefer them smashburger style. I usually do these in a pan because I like extra crunch & I always think grills are a little sus with the meat contamination. But I've grilled them too and they are sturdy enough for that as well. They also freeze great! So I make a full recipe-- lay them on a sheet pan to freeze and then pop them in a stasher bag until I'm ready to pull them out 1-2 at a time. \n\nI have handed this out to so many guests who are likewise enthralled. \n\nBottom line: make these, you won't be sorry!"
